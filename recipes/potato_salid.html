    <p>This recipe is very flexible so you can change the amount of ingrediants to your preferances and even add other ingrediants</p>

    <h3>Ingrediants</h3>

      <li>5 hardboiled eggs</li>
      <li>Mayo</li>
      <li>Bacon</li>
      <li>salt</li>
      <li>pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Assembaly</h3>
    <ol>
      <li> Cook the potatos by Boiling water in a pot and cook for an hour (You can check whether of not their done by sticking a knife in them and if they're soft, then they are done) </li>
      <li> Boil water in a seperate pot and cook the eggs for 20min</li>
      <li> Cook the bacon at 400Â°F and cook for 20-25 min(watch closely! bacon cooks fast)</li>

      <li> When the eggs are done, let them cool for 5-10 min and then peel and dice them up</li>
      <li> mix the potatos, eggs and crumble up the bacon into a bowl </li>
      <li> add mayo to your preferance(I like enough to add a thin coat to all the ingrediants)</li>
      <li> sprinkle in the salt and pepper and mix</li>
      <li> let sit in the fridge for an hour and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
